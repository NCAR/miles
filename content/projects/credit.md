The MILES team has developed [CREDIT](https://github.com/NCAR/miles-credit), An open foundational platform for developing and deploying AI weather and Earth system prediction models. CREDIT enables users to build custom data and modeling pipelines to load data, train configurable AI forward models, and deploy them for real-time forecasting, hindcasting, or scenario projections.

CREDIT offers both scientifically validated model configurations and endless customization for any use case.
