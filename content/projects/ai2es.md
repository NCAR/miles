AI2ES is the NSF AI Institute for Research on Trustworthy AI in Weather, Climate, and Coastal Oceanography. The vision of AI2ES is to create trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods for diverse environmental science (ES) users that will revolutionize our understanding and prediction of high-impact atmospheric and ocean science phenomena and create new educational pathways to develop a more diverse AI and environmental science workforce.

MILES's role in AI2ES is in developing more physics-guided explainable AI methods, developing and evaluating more robust uncertainty quantification methods and deriving deeper physical understanding from analysis of the uncertainties. MILES has hosted multiple SIParCS interns funded by AI2ES and has co-led two Trustworthy AI for Environmental Science Summer Schools.
